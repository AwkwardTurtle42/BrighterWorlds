# Introduction

Brighter Worlds is a fantasy tabletop RPG for going adventuring, crawling through dungeons, and playing through all of the OSR modules I’ve acquired over the years but haven’t gotten a chance to run yet.

It’s designed to appeal to a very particular sort of table, specifically my own. The base of the game uses the ultra pared-down ruleset of Into the Odd (more specifically the Cairn implementation of those rules) but additional complexity and crunch has been built back on top of that foundation.

My goal for players was to provide a system that would let them build unique characters, let them grow and gain new abilities as they adventure, and to make danger and the threat of death meaningful without being omnipresent.

My goal for the GM was to provide all of that to the players, without adding additional complexity to the GM facing rules. The game should be governed by a small set of simple rules, with GM rulings to fill the gaps. Building NPCs and monsters on the fly should be quick and easy. 

The way I’ve (attempted to) accomplish this is to make the more complex rules and systems both modular, and primarily player facing. Modular means that each subsystem contained within a player class generally only affects that class and any players who choose it. Player facing means the GM shouldn’t be doing bookkeeping for Class abilities, or even remember they exist most of the time. All that’s required is for the GM to make rulings as necessary.

And that’s how we got here. Rules light framework for the GM to interface with. Character creation that is hopefully complex and flexible enough to satisfy players and make every character unique, even within the same class. Advancement that combines earning XP and buying upgrades within your own class, but growing and learning through ‘foreground, diegetic growth’ tied into the fiction of the game.

Although I wrote this specifically for me to play it with my friends, I hope that others can find some use out of what I’ve written here.

Brighter Worlds is not done. Some of it is just plain unwritten, most of it is untested, and the editing leaves a lot to be desired. Expect this game to grow and change as time goes on.


# Core Rules


## Attributes

Characters have three Attributes represented by dice ranging in size from d4 to d12. 

Strength (STR): Represents physical power, toughness, and endurance.

Dexterity (DEX):  Represents speed, reflexes, and precision.

Willpower (WIL): Represents mental focus, toughness, and endurance.

These present both a character’s prowess, and current status. If STR ever drops below a d4 that character dies. If DEX drops below d4 the character is paralyzed. If WIL drops below a d4 the character is catatonic.


## Saves

When you want to do something, describe how you go about it and the GM will tell you if it’s possible, and inform you of any obvious consequences of your action.

If the action carries risk or uncertainty, you’ll make a Save by rolling your appropriate Attribute die and trying to beat:



*   a 4, if the risk comes from the environment.
*   another creature’s Attribute die if they’re directly opposing you.

If you **win_ _**by rolling higher, you’ll get what you want and avoid the risks.

If you **lose** by rolling lower, you’ll suffer the consequences and possibly fail your task.

If you **tie** by matching your target, you’ll have to make do with a compromise, tough choice, or succeed with a drawback.


### Save Modifiers

If you’re in a good position, but something could still go wrong, your Save is **_enhanced _**and you roll a d12 in addition to your Attribute die, and keep whichever is higher.

If you’re in a rough position, and the best you can hope for is only partly mitigating the risks, your Save is **_impaired _**and you’ll roll a d4 instead of your Attribute die.


## Dice

Dice range in size from d4 to d12. If an effect tells you to step a die up or down, move it right or left along this track:

 \
d4 &lt;-> d6 &lt;-> d8 &lt;-> d10 &lt;-> d12


# Magic

Anyone can cast spells and perform rituals, they just need a Grimoire to store them in.


## Grimoires

Grimoires are _bulky_ tomes which can store any number of spells and rituals.

Spells and rituals can be copied from one Grimoire (or other source) to another, but doing so takes time (about an hour), resources (fancy pens and ink), and removes the magic from the original source.


## Rituals

Rituals can be powerful and long lasting, but are often time consuming and inconvenient to perform.

To perform a ritual, read it out of the Grimoire it is stored in while performing any required actions and sacrificing any required components. This takes ten minutes, unless otherwise specified. 

Rushing the process may be possible, but will always carry a degree of risk.


## Spells

Spells are quick and easy to cast, but tend to have flashy and fleeting effects.

To cast a spell, hold the Grimoire in both hands and read the spell aloud.

If you have Grit, set your Grit to zero to cast the spell.

If you have no Grit, make a WIS Save:

**Win**: The spell is cast successfully.

**Tie**: The spell is cast successfully, but your WIL is stepped down.

**Lose**: You WIL steps down. Either you are knocked unconscious, or the spell misfires (your choice).


### Spells In Combat

When you cast a spell against a creature that is actively trying to avoid it, if the spell deals damage simply use that damage as a normal attack.

If the spell does not deal damage, roll your WIL as though it were a damage die. If that attack would deal Critical Damage, instead your spell takes effect.


# Combat


## Rounds and Initiative

When engaging in combat time is tracked in increments called Rounds. A Round lasts about 10 seconds, or enough time for someone to run across a room and perform one significant action.

During each round, each side of a conflict takes a Turn to act. Within a side’s Turn, each individual can act in whatever order they choose, although all declared attacks are resolved simultaneously (see below). During a Turn a character can move about 40 feet, and perform one significant action (make an attack, use an item, cast a spell, etc.). Any actions that carry risk require a Save as usual, usually against the creature you’re engaged with.

If it’s not clear which side should act first, initiative should be determined by the leader of each side should make DEX Saves against each other (_enhancing_ or _impairing_ the Save as usual).


## Attacking

To make an attack, roll your weapon’s damage die. The target of the attack subtracts their armor and reduces their Grit by the result. If there is no excess damage, the target was able to avoid or otherwise defend against the attack. If there is more damage dealt than the remaining Grit, the excess damage becomes Critical Damage.


## Critical Damage

Any damage dealt in excess of remaining Grit becomes Critical Damage. When you receive Critical Damage, make a STR Save with the amount of Critical Damage as the target:

Win: The damage is minor, you are not significantly harmed.

Tie: The damage is significant, reduce your STR but you remain upright.

Lose: The damage is severe, reduce your STR and become incapacitated.

An incapacitated creature is knocked down and completely helpless. Without assistance they will die within an hour.

If a creature’s STR steps below a d4, they die.


## Attack Modifiers

If you make an attack that is at an advantage (against an unsuspecting target, from higher ground, etc.) it is _enhanced_. Roll a d12 in addition to your other dice, and keep only the highest result. 

If you attack while disadvantaged (through cover, while blind, while restrained, etc.) it is _imparied_. Roll a d4 instead of your other dice.


## Blast

Attacks with the Blast quality affect all targets in the area. This can refer to actual explosions, to fireballs, to whirling blades and giant sized cleaving blades.


## Ganging Up

All attacks against a single target are rolled simultaneously, and only the single highest die is dealt as damage. This applies both to multiple attackers, and to single attackers wielding multiple weapons.


## Combat Maneuvers

You make an _impaired_ attack alongside a minor action, as long as you could plausibly do both. This covers attempting to disarm a creature, knock them off a cliff, or similar.

If your attack would be _enhanced_ you can make a normal attack alongside your action.


## What’s It mean?

Attacks that are reduced to zero damage by armor are totally deflected or completely harmless.

_An arrow pinging off your heavy armor._

Attacks that reduce Grit but do not cause physical damage are avoided, dodged, or repelled. 

_A sword thrust caught by your shield and turned aside._

Attacks that cause Critical Damage have slipped past armor and defense to make an actual impact on flesh. 

_Blocking one thrust with a shield while a second slips past._

A successful Save versus Critical Damage means the injury is minor.

_A dagger slashing too fast to dodge, leaving a bleeding cut across your shoulder._

A failed Save versus Critical Damage means the wound is serious, and lasting. Such wounds are potentially lethal if not treated, and will likely inhibit the wounded character fictionally even after they’re stabilized. 

_A spear stabbing entirely through a leg, causing the character to collapse to the ground gushing blood._


# Healing and Recovery


## Catching Your Breath

When you have a few minutes to catch your breath and drink some water, you restore all of your Grit back to its maximum. Doing so in a dungeon or hazardous environment may expose the party to danger.


## Attribute Recovery

Attribute loss can be restored with medical care, magic, or a lengthy rest in comfort.


## Deprivation

If you are deprived of vital needs for a full day (food, water, rest) you are _deprived_ and cannot regain Grit.


## Death

When your STR steps below a d4 you die. 

The rest of the table should take turns reading your Eulogy in memory of your character’s life. Once done, create a new character and rejoin the group. Prioritize expediency over realism.


### Optional Rule: The Mark of Death

Use this rule to increase character survivability, or to add an extra bit of drama to the death of a character.

When a character dies, they approach the Black River where Death greets them. The player describes who Death appears as, and what they can glimpse beyond the Black River. Then, they roll a d6:

1: The character is taken across the Black River by Death.

2-3: Death offers them a deal. If they accept the terms, they are returned to life.

4-6: It is not their time. They return to life marked by Death in some way.

If a character is already Marked By Death, the 4-6 result is replaced with the 2-3 result.


# Items


## Inventory and Bulky Items

You can carry as much as is realistic, but if you are carrying more than two _bulky_ items you are _deprived_ and cannot regain grit.


## Armor

Armor (i.e. 1 Armor)  subtracts its score from the result of damage rolls against you. Items, such as shields, that grant bonus armor only apply while the item is held (i.e. +1 Armor).

You cannot have more than Armor 3 in total. 

Single pieces of armor that grants 2 Armor are rare, and usually carry some sort of drawback or limitation.


## Ammo

Ammunition (arrows, bolts, bullets, etc.) are generally not tracked and considered to be unlimited in supply, unless specific circumstances would lead to it being in short supply. 

Unique or speciality ammo is tracked individually. 


## Optional Rule: Wilderness Survival

Use this rule to add pressure to return to long trips through the wilderness, and to make deciding what to carry and how many Supplies to bring an interesting decision. Supplies (_bulky_) can be purchased in most settlements and cities, and are an abstraction of food, water, and general survival equipment.

Once a day, when the party is away from easy access to food and water, the party picks someone to lead the survival efforts. That person makes a Save with an Attribute based on their approach (fishing, hunting, scavenging, etc.). This Save can be _enhanced_ or _impaired_ as usual based on the hospitality (or lack thereof) of the environment or weather conditions.

**Win**: The party manages to hunt, gather, or scavenge sufficient resources to get through the next day.

**Tie**: As a win, but everyone is annoyed or uncomfortable.

**Lose**: The party is _deprived_ for the next day unless a package of Supplies is consumed.


# Advancement and Growth


## Eulogy and XP

Your eulogy is the list of your deeds and accomplishments that will be read at your eventual death. Whenever your character does something noteworthy enough to be mentioned in their Eulogy, write down what it was and earn 1 XP. These moments can be heroic deeds, desperate acts, cunning plans, or even comical gaffs. They can be shared across the whole group, or individual to just one character. If there’s ever any doubt as to if something counts, the table votes.


## Class Advancement

Spend XP to unlock abilities and make your character stronger. Spending XP represents your character’s ability to grow and improve using only their own practice, experience, and training.



*   Spend 1 XP to gain +1 Maximum Grit
*   Spend 1 XP to increase a d4 Attribute to a d6. Each step requires 1 additional XP to advance.
*   Spend 1+N XP to gain an Advanced Ability within your own class, where N is the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have.


## Foreground Growth

XP is not the only way you will grow and change. You can gain new abilities or skills by seeking out magic, powers, people and opportunities. Gain leathery wings by eating the heart of a demon, open your inner eye by meditating for a week and a day with ancient monks, learn the formulae to the elixir of life by plundering the libraries of the Lich Mage.

Similarly, gaining access to new Classes is done within the narrative of the game. Getting access to a new Class usually requires significant, intentional effort.


# Character Creation

A character is mechanically made of Attributes, Grit, and a Class.


## Attributes

Each of your Attributes (STR, DEX, and WIL) begin at a d6.

Step up the die for one of your Attributes to a d8.


## Grit

Grit is a character’s ability to avoid being harmed. It represents a combination of defensive capabilities, awareness, and luck.

Your Maximum Grit is determined by your Class.


## Classes

All characters are generalists. Everyone can swing a sword, sneak around, or cast a spell. Classes define the things that put you ahead of the pack, the things that give you an extra edge or let you break the rules.

Your class gives you your Maximum Grit, a Core Ability, and some equipment. Each class has a series of Advanced Abilities that can be unlocked with earned XP.

Choose a class, or roll a d12 to pick one randomly. Then create your character following the instructions in the class, or roll a d6 to randomly choose one of the Starter Packages as a premade character.


# Classes


## Artificer

_Your habit of always taking things apart to learn how they worked didn’t always endear you to people. When you started putting things back together people were mollified. Once they realized the things you’d put back together were better than before? That’s when you got popular._


### Core Ability

Walking Workshop: You can upgrade mundane items, or create new objects, with a single _improvement_ using your Portable Workshop. All such objects are _volatile_, unless significant time and effort is put into their production.

When a _volatile _item is used, roll a d6 (usage counts as dealing Critical Damage for weapon, receiving Critical Damage for armor, or performing their purpose for items).

1: It breaks immediately (and likely violently).

2-3: It’s noticeably damaged, and will break after its next use.

4-6: It’s fine for now.

## Chaos Sorcerer

_A spirit of chaos, better known as a demon, shares space in your head. In exchange for the shelter your body provides, it grants you access to it’s knowledge and skills picked up from prior hosts. Sometime, when you die, it will leap to a new body and share _your_ skills and knowledge, but you might prefer not to think about that._


### You Start With

*   A Demon In Your Brain - Your Demon acts like a hands free Spellbook with opinions. It knows one random spell and one random ritual, as well as one spell and one ritual of your choice.
*   An Unusual Choice of Clothing - Your Demon insists on it.

*   Stored Chaos: While using Chaos Magic you can store a single instance of chaos within you which can be unleashed later as usual, or as a d8 bolt of pure chaos.
*   Inherited Knowledge: Choose a topic based on your Demon’s prior host. Use it as per the Archivist’s Deep Lore ability.
*   Backseat Driver: If you are ever knocked unconscious or have your mind imparied in any way, you can choose to have your Demon take over and control your body instead.


## Witch

_Familiar at your side, you channel the forces of magic across the magical bond that connects you. You are a shepherd to ancient secrets, passed from person to person to keep them safe from forces who would rather see it lost. _


### Core Ability

Familiar Bond: You have magically bonded to a small creature. This bond allows you to channel magic through the Familiar, letting it cast spells for you. Familiars explode, pop, evaporate, or die in some other way if their WIL steps below a d4. Familiars can be resummoned in an hour long ritual.


### You Start With:



*   3 Grit
*   A Grimoire (_bulky_), containing two spells and one ritual of your choice.
*   A Fanciful Hat
*   A Familiar (1Grit, d4/d4/d4 stats, d4 attack, plus two options from the Beastmaster Animal Companion list)


### Advanced Advancements

Unlock these abilities by spending 1 + N XP where N is the number of Advanced Abilities you already have.



*   Witch’s Curse: Make eye contact with a character and pronounce doom against them. Make a WIL Save vs their WIL. Success: Bad fortune befalls them immediately. Tie: Soon. Fail: Eventually. If you take time to make a proper curse (with a rhyming incantation, rare ingredients, etc.) you can create a lasting effect (although there must always be a way to break it).
*   Familiar Sights: You can borrow the senses of your familiar and guide them remotely.
*   Unfamiliar Familiar: Each time you resummon your Familiar you can choose a new animal form for it to take (adjusting the Animal Companion options as needed).
*   Witch Steed: In your hands a broom, cauldron, or other household object becomes a flying steed. It can carry you and your familiar at a running pace.


## Alchemist

_Through branch and root you know how to unlock the secrets of the earth. You use this knowledge to wrench the very world to will._


### Core Ability

Branch and Bone: You can distill plants, minerals, animal parts, and other ingredients into potion components. With the necessary components, you can brew doses of any potion whose recipe you know.


### You Start With



*   Best of 2d6 Grit
*   Recipe Book (_bulky_) - Acts as a Grimoire that can also store your potion recipes. Contains two potion recipes (work with the GM).
*   Potion Making Equipment: mortar and pestle, assorted glassware, etc.
*   A Potion Bandolier - Contains one vial each of your starting potion recipes.


### Advanced Advancements

Unlock these abilities by spending 1 + N XP where N is the number of Advanced Abilities you already have.



*   Alchemic Distillation: You can distill the Spells and Rituals in your Recipe Book into potions. Distilling rituals still requires any components the ritual itself does. Once distilled, “cast” the potion by drinking, pouring, or throwing it (ignore the usual costs).
*   Homebrewer: You can brew beverages the same way you can brew potions, except they only take one potion component alongside a fermentable (grain, fruit, sugar, etc.). Your beverages produce more mild effects than potions, but you can create large batches at once.
*   Topical Treatment: You can produce potions that can be applied in ways other than drinking, such as breathable fumes, topical ointments, or smeared onto weapons.
*   Fine Palate: You are immune (unless you choose otherwise) to the effects of anything you imbibe, and can identify all ingredients it contains.


### Potion Recipes

A potion recipe must contain at least two dissimilar components along with some brewing requirement. Any potion effect is possible, but the required components and process may be esoteric or prohibitive. To create a new potion recipe, explain the desired effects along with the proposed recipe, the GM will tell you if it could work, or if one or more more of the following are true:



*   It will require one or more additional components.
*   It requires a laborious, time consuming, or difficult to achieve brewing step.
*   It takes a large amount of raw materials to produce a single dose.
*   It creates an unstable, volatile potion that must be used quickly or lose its efficacy.
*   The process is uncertain, and the final effect will depend on a random roll.
*   It will have an unintended side effect when consumed.


## Great Soul Shaman

_The soul of a great beast lives within you, granting you it’s skills and form. Shamanic ritual prepares for such a transfer, layering soul upon soul of generations of the animal until it is ready to make a Shaman._


### Core Ability

Great Soul: Choose the animal whose soul lives within you. You may transform into that animal (with a WIL Save if doing it quickly). You retain your own Grit and can rearrange your Attributes to suit the animal. You gain whatever strengths and weaknesses that animal has, including attacks, armor, locomotion, and senses. 

Gain additional animal souls through shamanic rituals, quests for Animal Gods, or other esoteric means.


### You Start WIth



*   3 Grit
*   Melee Weapon (d6) 
*   Ranged Weapon (d8, _bulky_)
*   A physical quirk from your Great Soul
*   An inconvenient instinct from your Great Soul


### Advanced Advancements

Unlock these abilities by spending 1 + N XP where N is the number of Advanced Abilities you already have.



*   Nature’s Tongue: You can communicate clearly with animals whose soul you share. You can communicate with difficulty to animals _similar_ to those spirits.
*   Psychopomp: When you are attendant to the death of a creature (caused by you or not) you may temporarily take custody of its soul. You can use your Great Soul ability to take that creature’s form once, but afterwards the soul passes beyond the Black River.
*   Soul Sight: You can blind yourself to the material world to see creature’s souls. You can see, through all but the most powerful of illusions, what sort of creature they are and their mood.
*   Speaker to the Dead: You can consult with the lingering souls and spirits of those who died nearby. Recalcitrant spirits may require offerings or favors before helping.


## Blessed of the Water

_Were you granted a boon by an ocean goddess? Are you the daughter of a river spirit? Perhaps you did some great deed for the guardian of a particular cove? Your watery patron granted you a part of itself and bound you to water. They are not a dominant presence in your journey, but their support is constant and you hear their voice in the patter of rain, the burble of a creek, or the crash of ocean waves._


### Core Ability

A Thing of the Sea: You are equally at home in water as you are on land and you can control a volume of water about the size of a person.

Name your Patron (the spirit, body, or source of water that has claimed you), and choose the blessing it grants (or use a Starter Package).


### Water Blessings



1. Fluid Form: Turn into water, but have only minimal control over your movement (if a liquid you can’t flow uphill, if a gas wind currents dictate your direction).
2. Font of Self: Produce water, about a gallon per hour.
3. Thermo Regulation: Change the state of water in one direction (the states are solid, liquid, and gas).
4. Tip Of The Iceberg: Your water control volume expands 10 fold.
5. Water Sight: The first time you immerse yourself in a body of water you may ask your patron one question about something that water touches.
6. Healing Waters: Stabilize wounds by pouring water over them. Submerge a wound in water for a watch to restore one step of Attribute loss.


### You Start With:



*   3 Grit
*   A waterskin
*   A small, impossible token from your Patron


### Advanced Advancements

Unlock these abilities by spending 1 + N XP where N is the number of Advanced Abilities you already have.



*   Very Blessed: You are granted a second Water Blessing.
*   Water Walk: You (and any companions you choose to bring with you) may leap into a body of water, and emerge from the most recent body of water you were fully submerged in.
*   Liquid Construction: You can shape water into single use tools and equipment. You can also create weapons (d8) that last until they deal Critical Damage, and armor (1 Armor) that lasts until the wearer receives Critical Damage.
*   Water Tongue: You can communicate with any creature that claims water as its home.


## Archivist

_You’ve always liked knowing things. Collecting information and stories like a squirrel collecting nuts for the winter. Frustrated with incomplete, inconsistent, and obviously biased records you’ve emerged from your study to do first hand research and correct the record. _


### Core Ability

Deep Lore: Pick a topic, whenever you first encounter something within that topic you may ask the GM a question about it. The GM will answer truthfully to the extent that the answer is knowable. Further questions require additional study, research, investigation or time.


### You Start With:



*   3 Grit
*   Your Archive (_bulky_): You may take a day to record a new Topic of information into your archive from some source of knowledge (library, archive, storyteller, elder). You may use your Deep Lore ability on any Topic contained in your archive, but only after taking the time to look it up.
*   Wire Rimmed Reading Glasses
*   Knife-Pen (d6) and Ink
*   A _knack_ you picked up during your studies.


### Advanced Advancements

Unlock these abilities by spending 1 + N XP where N is the number of Advanced Abilities you already have.



*   Method of Loci: You’ve memorized your entire Archive. It still takes you time to look things up (walking around your memory palace) but it’s always with you.
*   Monster Manual: Thoroughly examine a creature to add it to your Archive. You have +1 armor against them and may ask questions about them as per Deep Lore. If you’ve added 3 similar creatures, add their Family to your Archives as a Topic.
*   Psychometry: You can read an object’s history just by touching it. When you handle an object you can sense events that have happened to it. Emotionally charged and recent events take precedence, but with careful study you may ask specific questions.
*   Expert Reader: No matter the language, culture, code, cypher, or style you can always quickly discern the intent and meaning of any writing.


## Runewright

_You are a runewright, you imbue and channel power through engraved symbols of power. You are no wizard. You’re above running around shooting crude magic from your fingertips, blasting things with fireballs. Runes are sophisticated. Runes are subtler, slower, and longer lasting than spells. Anyone can pick up a spellbook and cast a spell, crafting runes takes refinement. And you are refined._


### Core Ability

Runic Magic: You can inscribe runes that incorporate one Element, one Verb, and one Subject. Empower and activate an inscribed rune with a drop of your own, fresh blood and a point of Max Grit. You can deactivate a rune at will to recover the spent Max Grit.


### You Start WIth



*   3 Grit
*   Knowledge of 2 Elements, 2 Verbs, and 2 Subjects
*   Hammer (d6) and Chisel (d6)
*   Flawless handwriting


### Advanced Advancements

Unlock these abilities by spending 1 + N XP where N is the number of Advanced Abilities you already have.



*   Expansive Research: Learn the remaining Elements, Verbs and Subjects from the standard lists.
*   Synergistic Conjunctions: You have learned to write runes that incorporate two Elements simultaneously.
*   Rune Logic: You learn to add Modifiers as a fourth component of a rune:
    *   If: Set a condition under which an empowered run will activate.
    *   Not: Invert the effects of the Verb or Element used in a rune.
*   Esoteric Elements: Learn how to manipulate the following two elements in your runes:
    *   Time: dealing with speeding or slowing things
    *   Space: dealing with locations and distances


### Rune Components

Runic magic is subtler than both Spells and Rituals, dealing mostly with modifying existing things. The effects are long lasting, but generally less power.

When you inscribe a rune, tell the GM what your intended effect is and what components you plan to use to achieve that. They’ll tell you if that’s possible, or if you’ll have to do more to achieve your goal.



*   Elements:
    *   Air: breathing, flight, wind
    *   Fire: burning, heat
    *   Earth: stone, weight
    *   Water: liquid, 
*   Verb
    *   Enhance: Addition, amplification
    *   Impair: Reduction, suppression
    *   Move: Motive force, relocation
    *   Create: Production, renewal
    *   Destroy: Removal, decay
*   Subject
    *   Self: relating to the element itself
    *   Object: relating to an inanimate object
    *   Creature: relating to a person or being


## Grimblade

_You are a grimblade and you have a grimblade, a unique and very large weapon that you’ve learned the trick of putting spells in. Whether you physically inscribe it onto a meteor metal blade, or embed the spells into a crystal hammer, you find this eminently more practical than lugging a big book around._


### Core Ability

Grimblade: Your Grimblade acts as a Grimoire. Use STR rather than WIL to cast spells if you have zero Grit. You may cast spells and rituals from it as usual, but additionally if you deal Critical Damage with the weapon you may cast a spell (not ritual) ignoring the usual costs.


### You Start WIth



*   2 Grit
*   Your Grimblade: d10, _bulky_, containing 2 spells of your choice. It is any type of melee weapon, made of some unusual material. Your Grimblade is indestructible, and you always know where it is.
*   Unusual Armor (1 Armor)


### Advanced Advancements

Unlock these abilities by spending 1 + N XP where N is the number of Advanced Abilities you already have.



*   Mystic Strike: Drop your Grit to zero to deal max damage on an attack. You can only do this if you’re not already at zero Grit.
*   Spell Disruption: You can destroy weak (and disrupt powerful) ongoing spells and enchantments with your Grimblade. If there is risk of magical backlash, you can make a STR Save to avoid it.
*   Hammerspace: You can store your Grimblade in a sub dimensional space (a Mary Poppins bag, a small portal, a tattoo, etc.) where it can be retrieved instantly.
*   I, Grimblade: Whether through the magic stored within or from other means, your Grimblade has become sentient and ambulatory. It can float, act, and attack on its own.


## Cleric of Small Gods

_Carry a small god around with you. You protect it, rather than the other way around. Possibly a baby god, a god of a small concept, a recently reincarnated god, a local god whose home was destroyed, or a ‘killed’ god. _


### Core Ability

Words of God: Gods can speak only truth. When you speak with the words of your god the words are either true, or your god’s energy will attempt to _make_ it true. Such statements can only be made within your god’s domain, and carry some risk.


### You Start With



*   3 Grit
*   A Small God - Determine its name, domain, and form.
*   A ceremonial object (d6)
*   Formal vestments


### Statement Stability

The Stability of a statement starts at a d10 for narrow domains, d8 for normal domains, and d6 for broad domains. It is a reflection of how willing the universe is to accept the new truth, the more it clashes with the universe the more unstable it becomes. \
 \
Step down the Stability for each of the following that are true of the statement:



*   It impacts things outside of your line of sight.
*   It directly contradicts the natural working of the world.
*   It describes a long lasting effect (step up twice for permanent).
*   It is a poor fit for your god’s domain.

Step up the Stability for each of the following that are true of the statement:



*   It impacts only things you are touching.
*   It is copacetic with the natural working of the world.
*   It describes a fleeting effect.
*   It is a perfect fit for your god’s domain.

If the Stability steps below a d4, the statement is impossible (the universe will reject it). If the Stability steps above a d12 it takes effect without a roll.

Roll the Stability Die as a normal Save.

Win: The statement takes effect.

Lose: The universe pushes back (i.e. step down WIL, unintended side effects, etc.)

Tie: Both.


### Advanced Advancements

Unlock these abilities by spending 1 + N XP where N is the number of Advanced Abilities you already have.



*   Offerings: Appropriate sacrifices or offerings made to your God will increase Stability, commensurate to the thing being offered.
*   Gemini: Your god has a second domain. It is the mirror of the first, the other side of the coin, or otherwise complementary.
*   Divine Colleagues: Your god can always tell you which (if any) god or spirit claims an area, as well as how to contact them.
*   Holy Site: Spend a week and a suitably impressive offering to create a holy site for your god. It shields those within from outside influence, and alerts you to any malicious interlopers. You may teleport yourself and your companions to this location, but the site loses all benefits until it is re-sanctified with a new offering.

## When To Roll?

The following process is to help the GM determine how to adjudicate situations, and when to call for Saves.



1. The player declares their intent, describing their goal and their approach.
2. Determine if the action is possible. Consider the situation, the player’s approach, their tools, abilities, skills, background, if they have help, and any other relevant details.
    1. If it’s impossible, tell the player. They can choose to revise their approach, or change their intended action.
    2. If it’s possible, continue to 3.
3. If it’s possible, then consider if there are any risks to the action.
    3. If there are no risks, or the risks are fully mitigated, the player’s actions can go ahead without any drawbacks.
    4. If the action would entail unavoidable risks, tell the player what those consequences are. They can choose to accept them, or revise their approach.
    5. If there are potential but uncertain risks, continue to 4.
4. The player’s action requires them to make a Save to avoid the risks.
    6. If the approach means that, at best, the risks will be only partly mitigated the Save is _imparied_.
    7. If the approach means the risks are unlikely, but still possible, the Save is _enhanced_.
    8. If neither a or b apply, the Save is rolled as normal.
5. Tell the player the potential outcomes as far as their character could plausible know them (always err on the side of giving too much information). The player can then choose to roll, or revise their approach.
6. Roll the dice, and honor the results.


## NPCs and Monsters


### General Principles

A starting point for any NPC would be 3 Grit, a d6 weapon, and a d6 in each Attribute.



*   Attributes: d4 is weak, d6 is average, d8 is noteworthy, d10 is strong and d12 is legendary. Adjust attributes only for significant exceptions to the average.
*   Typical creatures will have 3 Grit, hardy ones 6 Grit, and serious threats 10+. Avoid giving too much Grit or combat becomes a slog.
*   Use flavor and style to make NPCs stand out, not everything needs unique attributes or abilities.
*   Making monster abilities that trigger on Critical Damage is a good way to emphasize the threat or strangeness of aggressive NPCs.
*   Remember that Grit is the ability to avoid harm, not health. It’s a measure of resilience and gumption, not meat.


### Morale Saves

When an NPC faces daunting, terrifying, or dangerous situations they should make a WIL Save to see if they persevere:

**Win**: They push through the fear, or continue the fight.

**Tie**: They hesitate, falter, or flinch.

**Lose**: They refuse to go further, or flee the danger.

In battle, NPCs should make Morale Saves when they take Critical Damage for the first time, the first time one of their companions is taken down, or if the tide of battle turns obviously against them.

Other situations for Morale Saves include an NPC being presented with a situation dramatically out of their understanding, hirlinges being pushed to put themselves at significant risk or being asked to continue into an obviously dangerous situation.

As with all Saves, a Morale Save can be _enhanced_ (a courageous leader, promise of significant reward, being particularly oblivious) or _impaired_ (being directly threatened, the situation is hopeless, the evidence of danger is immediate and obvious).


## Making Magic

Spell effects should be fast, flashy, and fleeting. Spells can be cast repeatedly and essentially no cost, so avoid effects that would be annoying or unfun if used repeatedly.

Rituals can be more impactful and long lasting. If an effect has the potential to be problematic, add a required component or a requirement that is sufficiently inconvenient to properly temper how often it can be used.

Even more powerful effects can either be embedded in single use magic items, or rituals/items with significant or difficult to achieve requirements to use.


## New Classes

The key to any core class ability is flexibility and scope. A core ability should be evocative and interesting, and flexible enough that two players could both choose it without causing an awkward overlap within the party. A good test for this is to see how easy it is to create a number of Starter Packages that feel interesting and unique.

Class abilities should always _add_ options and capability. No abilities should ever limit the options of other characters, the goal should never be to put the GM in a position where they have to tell a player they cannot attempt something because it would step on the toes of another class.
